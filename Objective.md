Comparing the accuracy rate in K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm and Decision Tree Algorithm
=========



The aim is to detect a room's occupancy from the measurements of Temperature, Humidity, Light, CO2, in an office room, so smart building energy management system can be developed.
The data set is called Occupancy Detection Data set and it can be downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+#
* Classification accuracy percentage on the test data using K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm
* Classification accuracy percentage on the test data using Decision tree Algorithm
